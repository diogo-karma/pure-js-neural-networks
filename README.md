# Neural Network with Pure JS

## Description
This project is an innovative exploration into the field of artificial intelligence. It involves the design and implementation of a neural network using only JavaScript, without the aid of any external libraries or frameworks. This approach not only provides a deeper understanding of the inner workings of neural networks, but also offers greater control over the customization and optimization of the network. The project serves as a valuable resource for those interested in machine learning and AI, particularly within the context of web development.
